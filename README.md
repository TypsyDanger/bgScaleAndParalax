# bgScaleAndParalax
Simple HTML, CSS, jQuery (2.1.4) &amp; JavaScript project that scales and scrolls the background image of a header.  Derived and extended from Mohiuddin Parrekh's tutorial at http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-parallax-scrolling-technique--net-27641

# Usage
1. Link jQuery and the project JavaScript file to your html file
2. Create a <header></header> section and style it as you need to
3. Add the following data attributes to the <header> opening tag:
    a. data-type="background"   //  Identifies this as the background to scale
    b. data-speed="2"           //  Adjust scroll speed
    c. data-scroll-stop="150"   //  Number of pixels to scroll to before stopping the scale downl
    d. data-scale="25"          */  Sets the scale percentage to use.  This is a down-scale percentage, not total scale. 
                                    Meaning 25 will reduce the scale to 75%, 33 will reduce scale to 67%, etc */
